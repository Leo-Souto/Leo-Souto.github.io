Hello, I'm a PhD student in Biology at New York University under supervision of Mercedes Pascual, and a member of <a href="https://covid19br.github.io/">Observatório COVID-19 BR</a>. I'm currently working with mathematical models of epidemics applied to urban malaria in India, studying the role of climate in transmission. I have experience with COVID-19 modeling, mostly concerning vaccination strategies. I also have experience in image processing of omnidirectional images with complex analysis and spatio-temporal chaos. Feel free to contact me.

### Urban malaria and Humidity

<img style="float: right;" src="images/anopheles_stephensi.jpeg" width = "300">


Using climate data and number of cases of malaria caused by *P. falciparum*, transmitted by *A. stephensi*, we plan to study the role of humidity with models that consider entomological characteristics of mosquitoes. This work has implications for malaria containment under climate change.

## Old Projects

### Mathematical Modelling of COVID-19

<img style="float: left; width: 300px;" src="images/covid_img.jpg">

We aim to help the understanding of COVID-19 epidemics through mathematical models, mainly compartmental ones, such as SEIR-like models. Our interests are variants, non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination scenarios. We use mainly data from Brazil.

### Omnidirectional Images and Moebius Transformations

<img style="float: right; width: 300px;" src="images/moebius_img.jpg">

In this project we aim to perceptually optimize omnidirectional images through Local Moebius Transformations, because of the relationship between the Complex Plane and Spherical Images.

### The Damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation

In this project, we aim to caracterize the phases of the damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation using his behavior in the frequency space via extensive simulations. We also use the Dynamical Systems approach, using parameters like Lyapunov Exponents.

### Dynamic Simulator

<img style="float: left; width: 300px;" src="images/2.png">

In this project we aim to create a multi purpose simulator, with focus in Dynamical Systems. The algorithm have versions in C/C++ and MATLAB/Octave.
