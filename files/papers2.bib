	abstract = {ABSTRACT: This article discusses the epidemic situation of Covid-19 in Brazil, in the face of the emergence of a new strain called P.1, which is more transmissible and may be associated with reinfection. Given the collapse of hospital care in Manaus in January 2021 and the results of three recent preprints, each that reports increased transmissibility of the P.1 variant, we propose some urgent measures. Genomic surveillance based on multi-step diagnostics, starting with RT-PCR type tests and up to sequencing, should be established. Efforts to identify reinfections associated with this variant and the update of its definition in protocols should be prioritized, and studies on the efficacy of currently available vaccines in Brazil concerning the new variant should be conducted. We also propose improving the Brazilian health surveillance system such that genomic surveillance is coordinated and thereby better able to respond to future emergencies in a more timely fashion. We call on the public agents involved in health surveillance to share data and information regarding the epidemic in a clear, fast and transparent way. Finally, we propose a greater engagement in inter-institutional cooperation of all those involved in the response and production of knowledge about the pandemic in our country.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a major concern all over the world and, as vaccines became available at the end of 2020, optimal vaccination strategies were subjected to intense investigation. Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. By maintaining the minimum stock of vaccines under a given production rate, we evaluate the dose interval that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to vaccinate the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the best strategy of time window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the best window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Modeling is important for guiding policy during epidemics. The objective of this work was to describe the experience of structuring a multidisciplinary collaborative network in Brazil for modeling coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to support decision-making throughout the pandemic.

Methods
Responding to a national call in June 2020 for proposals on COVID-19 mitigation projects, we established a team of investigators from public universities located in various regions throughout Brazil. The team’s main objective was to model severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission dynamics in various demographic and epidemiologic settings in Brazil using different types of models and mitigation interventions. The modeling results aimed to provide information to support policy making. This descriptive study outlines the processes, products, challenges, and lessons learned from this innovative experience.

Results
The network included 18 researchers (epidemiologists, infectious diseases experts, statisticians, and modelers) from various backgrounds, including ecology, geography, physics, and mathematics. The criteria for joining the network were having a communication channel with public health decision-makers and being involved in generating evidence for public policy. During a 24-month period, the following sub-projects were established: (i) development of a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-like, individual-based meta-population and Markov chain model; (ii) projection of COVID-19 transmission and impact over time with respect to cases, hospitalizations, and deaths; (iii) assessment of the impact of non-pharmacological interventions for COVID-19; (iv) evaluation of the impact of reopening schools; and (v) determining optimal strategies for COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we mapped existing COVID-19 modeling groups nationwide and conducted a systematic review of relevant published research literature from Brazil.

Conclusions
Infectious disease modeling for guiding public health policy requires interaction between epidemiologists, public health specialists, and modelers. Communicating modeling results in a non-academic format is an additional challenge, so close interaction with policy makers is essential to ensure that the information is useful. Establishing a network of modeling groups will be useful for future disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Brazil experienced moments of collapse in its health system throughout 2021, driven by the emergence of variants of concern (VOC) combined with an inefficient initial vaccination strategy against Covid-19.
Objectives
To support decision-makers in formulating COVID-19 immunization policy in the context of limited vaccine availability and evolving variants over time, we evaluate optimal strategies for Covid-19 vaccination in Brazil in 2021, when vaccination was rolled out during Gamma variant predominance.
Methods
Using a discrete-time epidemic model we estimate Covid-19 deaths averted, considering the currently Covid-19 vaccine products and doses available in Brazil; vaccine coverage by target population; and vaccine effectiveness estimates. We evaluated a 5-month time horizon, from early August to the end of December 2021. Optimal vaccination strategies compared the outcomes in terms of averted deaths when varying dose intervals from 8 to 12 weeks, and choosing the minimum coverage levels per age group required prior to expanding vaccination to younger target populations. We also estimated dose availability required over time to allow the implementation of optimal strategies.
Results
To maximize the number of averted deaths, vaccine coverage of at least 80 \% should be reached in older age groups before starting vaccination into subsequent younger age groups. When evaluating varying dose intervals for AZD1222, reducing the dose interval from 12 to 8 weeks for the primary schedule would result in fewer COVID-19 deaths, but this can only be implemented if accompanied by an increase in vaccine supply of at least 50 \% over the coming six-months in Brazil.
Conclusion
Covid-19 immunization strategies should be tailored to local vaccine product availability and supply over time, circulating variants of concern, and vaccine coverage in target population groups. Modelling can provide valuable and timely evidence to support the implementation of vaccination strategies considering the local context, yet following international and regional technical evidence-based guidance.},

	abstract = {A pandemia de SARS-CoV-2 representou um grande desafio para a Saúde Pública em todo o mundo. O vírus se espalhou por quase todos os países e causou mais de 500 milhões de casos e 6 milhões de mortes até os dias de hoje (2022-04-20). No entanto, devido a investimentos maciços e fortes colaborações internacionais, várias vacinas contra a COVID-19 estavam disponíveis até o final de 2020. Isto levantou questões sobre como estas vacinas deveriam ser alocadas neste cenário de alta demanda e estoque escasso. Este trabalho contribui para esta discussão, desenvolvendo vários modelos relacionados à vacinação COVID-19. Primeiro fornecemos uma revisão da COVID-19 no Brasil, seguida por uma introdução à modelagem matemática de epidemias, com ênfase nos modelos de vacinação. Em seguida, mostramos três aplicações desta teoria às estratégias de vacinação contra a COVID-19 no Brasil. Como a maioria das vacinas desenvolvidas foram projetadas com uma implementação de duas doses de vacinação, uma das questões levantadas foi o intervalo ideal para cada vacina neste cenário de escassez de doses. Para responder a isto, desenvolvemos um modelo de equações diferenciais com atraso acoplado a um modelo de otimização para alocar entre a primeira e a segunda dose sem exigir reservas de doses. Concluímos que, se a eficácia da primeira dose em relação à segunda for inferior a 50\%, a melhor estratégia para reduzir as mortes é inocular a segunda dose o mais rápido possível, enquanto se a eficácia relativa for superior a 50\%, a estratégia depende fortemente da taxa de produção de doses de vacina ao longo do tempo. Se a taxa de produção for baixa, a melhor estratégia é retardar o máximo possível, enquanto que se a taxa de produção for maior, a estratégia ótima depende da eficácia relativa. Mostramos também que a janela de tempo ideal entre as doses não depende do número de reprodução efetivo da doença, mas este tem um papel na magnitude das mortes evitadas pela vacinação. À medida que a pandemia avançava e a variante Gama emergia no Brasil, as recomendações precisaram ser revisitadas. Desenvolvemos um modelo de vacinação estático de tempo discreto para avaliar a melhor estratégia para alocar doses de AZD1222 (AstraZeneca/Oxford/Fiocruz) com as novas estimativas de efetividade da vacina. Primeiro descobrimos que, em uma implementação baseada na idade, pelo menos 80\% de um grupo etário mais velho deveria ser vacinado antes de disponibilizar as vacinas para os indivíduos mais jovens, tendo mortes adicionais em geral, caso contrário. Em seguida, mostramos que o intervalo entre doses de AZD1222 deve ser reduzido de 12 para 8 semanas em uma epidemia dominada pela Gama e em um cenário ideal de disponibilidade de doses. Entretanto, mostramos que esta mudança de política só teria um efeito mensurável se o número de doses aumentasse em pelo menos 50\% da quantidade suprida pelo governo brasileiro até o final de 2021. No final de 2021, as vacinas infantis foram aprovadas pela Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) ao mesmo tempo em que a variante Delta estava sendo substituída pela variante Ômicron no Brasil. Desenvolvemos, então, um modelo dinâmico de duas linhagens em tempo discreto com reinfecção para avaliar o impacto da vacinação infantil (5 a 11 anos) em um cenário de substituição de variantes no Brasil. Estimamos que cerca de 2,4 mil internações e 180 mortes de crianças poderiam ser evitadas com o número de doses adquiridas pelo governo brasileiro, com um efeito indireto de redução de quase 10 mil internações e 1,5 mil mortes em todas as faixas etárias, entre meados de janeiro e abril de 2022. Mostramos também que o impacto da vacinação de crianças mais que duplica em uma implementação ótima (e alcançável) de 1 milhão de doses inoculadas por dia, com 5,4 mil internações e 410 mortes evitadas em crianças, com um efeito indireto de 26,5 mil internações e 4,2 mil mortes pela COVID-19 evitadas em todas as faixas etárias, evidenciando a necessidade de aumentar o número de doses supridas pelo governo brasileiro. Continuamos com uma introdução básica à modelagem estatística Bayesiana e uma visão geral da relativamente nova Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Em seguida, continuamos a desenvolver um modelo estatístico usando o INLA para estimar o impacto inicial da vacinação contra a COVID-19 no Brasil. Realizando uma análise contrafactual de um modelo autorregressivo com covariáveis de cobertura de vacinação explícitas, estimamos que a vacinação evitou diretamente cerca de 167 mil hospitalizações e 76 mil mortes pela COVID-19 no Brasil na faixa etária de alto risco de 60+ anos até o final de agosto de 2021. Ao deslocar a implementação da vacinação 4 e 8 semanas antes, estimamos que estes números aumentariam para 219 mil internações e 101 mil mortes, e 268 mil internações e 124 mil mortes, respectivamente, evidenciando o impacto se o planejamento e a aquisição de vacinas adequadas tivessem sido feitos pelo governo brasileiro. Terminamos este trabalho com algumas observações sobre o uso de modelagem matemática na saúde pública no Brasil.},

	abstract = {Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mathematical modelling has become an important tool for planning strategies to combat the pandemic by supporting decision-making and public policies, as well as allowing an assessment of the effect of different intervention scenarios. A proliferation of compartmental models were developed by the mathematical modelling community in order to understand and make predictions about the spread of COVID-19. While compartmental models are suitable for simulating large populations, the underlying assumption of a well-mixed population might be problematic when considering non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) which have a major impact on the connectivity between individuals in a population. Here we propose a modification to an extended age-structured SEIR (susceptible–exposed–infected–recovered) framework, with dynamic transmission modelled using contact matrices for various settings in Brazil. By assuming that the mitigation strategies for COVID-19 affect the connections among different households, network percolation theory predicts that the connectivity among all households decreases drastically above a certain threshold of removed connections. We incorporated this emergent effect at population level by modulating home contact matrices through a percolation correction function, with the few additional parameters fitted to hospitalisation and mortality data from the city of São Paulo. Our model with percolation effects was better supported by the data than the same model without such effects. By allowing a more reliable assessment of the impact of NPIs, our improved model provides a better description of the epidemiological dynamics and, consequently, better policy recommendations.},

Our goal is to offer guidelines for evidence-based policymaking. We implement an extended SEIR model stratified by age and considering contact networks in different settings – school, home, work, and community, in which the infection transmission rate is affected by various intervention measures. After fitting epidemiological and demographic data, we simulate scenarios with increasing school transmission due to school reopening, and also estimate the number of hospitalization and deaths averted by the implementation of contact tracing. Reopening schools results in a non-linear increase in reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, which is highly dependent on infection and disease incidence at the time of reopening. When contact tracing and quarantining are restricted to school and home settings, a large number of daily tests is required to produce significant effects in reducing the total number of hospitalizations and deaths. Policymakers should carefully consider the epidemiological context and timing regarding the implementation of school closure and return of in-person school activities. While contact tracing strategies prevent new infections within school environments, they alone are not sufficient to avoid significant impacts on community transmission.},

	abstract = {This work presents a new method to transform omnidirectional images based on a combination of Moebius transformations in the complex plane and weighting functions that restrict the action of these mappings to regions of interest. The transformations are calculated based on the specification of the image of three points and the weighting functions are designed to achieve specific goals such as local zoom or straight line rectification. Since no optimization or numerical methods are involved, our implementation of the proposed method can be upgraded to reach real-time performance. We provide a user interface and present many results that illustrate the potential of the proposed technique.},
